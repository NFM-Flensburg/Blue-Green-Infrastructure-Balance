## Installation

Currently, the plugin works only from a ZIP file.

1. [Download](https://github.com/NFM-Flensburg/Netto-Null-Bilanzierung/archive/master.zip) the master repository from GitHub.  
2. In QGIS, go to `Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins… → Install from ZIP` and select the downloaded ZIP file.  

---

## Usage

1. **Start the Plugin**  
   Open QGIS (version 3.16 or higher) and launch the plugin via the menu:  
   `Plugins → Net Zero Balance → Start`.

2. **Load Input Data**  
   The plugin requires **two vector layers** (or GeoJSON files):

   * **Before Layer** – contains the current sealed or built areas.  
   * **After Layer** – contains areas after / planned.

   Example data can be found in the `example_data/` folder of the plugin.  
   These can be loaded directly into QGIS via:  
   `Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer → GeoJSON`.

3. **Run the Analysis**  
   Select the layers and the corresponding fields with material or surface attributes in the plugin dialog.   

   The plugin calculates the **Blue-Green Balance** based on the *Biotope Area Factor Berlin (BFF 2020)*, taking into account the material or surface types.

4. **View and Export Results**  
   After the calculation:

   * The balance values are displayed in the plugin window.  
   * A **CSV file** with detailed results is saved to the output path you specify.  

5. **Interpretation**  
   * **Positive values** → additional sealing, compensation required.  
   * **Negative values** → balance improved (designed for de-sealing / ecological enhancement).  

> *For detailed error messages, open the Python Console in QGIS. All information will be printed there, including errors or successful results.*

## Background: Sealing and Blue-Green Infrastructure Balance

This plugin allows analysis and balancing of changes between **existing and new / planned states**. The approach follows the **Blue-Green Balance methodology**, evaluating changes in land surfaces with respect to their blue-green infrastructure qualities.  

The method combines quantitative area changes with qualitative evaluation factors (e.g., greening, permeability, de-sealing), enabling detailed ecological and climate-sensitive urban planning.

The Python script `script_core.py` can also be run standalone in the QGIS Python console and provides the following functions:

- **Read geospatial data** from a file (e.g., GeoPackage) or directly from QGIS layers.  
- **Overlay existing and planned polygons** to determine intersecting areas.  
- **Balance area changes** by categories (e.g., “Sealed,” “Partially Sealed,” “Green,” etc.).  
- **Factor-based scoring** according to the [Biotope Area Factor 2020 (BFF 2020)](https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/_assets/natur-gruen/landschaftsplanung/bff-biotopflaechenfaktor/broschuere_bff_gesamtbericht_iasp_20201215.pdf).  
- **Export results** as a CSV table with all areas and balance values.

## Evaluation Method – Biotope Area Factor 2020 (BFF 2020)

The plugin uses the **Biotope Area Factor 2020 (BFF)** from the  
[Institute for Agricultural and Urban Ecological Projects (IASP)](https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/_assets/natur-gruen/landschaftsplanung/bff-biotopflaechenfaktor/broschuere_bff_gesamtbericht_iasp_20201215.pdf)  
to assess the ecological effectiveness of surfaces with respect to:

- Microclimate  
- Air quality  
- Biodiversity  
- Rainwater management  
- Health and recreational quality  

Factor values range from **0 (fully sealed)** to **1 (vegetated area)**, including intermediate stages such as **partially sealed, vegetated paved surfaces, or green roofs**. This allows qualitative improvements (e.g., de-sealing or greening) to be represented in quantitative area balances.
