name=Blue-Green-Infrastrucuture Balance
description=Calculates Blue-Green Infrastructure balance based on before and after / planned land use layers.
about=This plugin supports municipalities, planners, and researchers in achieving land use neutrality by comparing sealed and unsealed surfaces between current and planned designs. It requires two layers (or GeoJSON files): one base layer with the current sealed areas and one planning layer with the proposed design. Based on the Biotopfl채chenfaktor Berlin (BFF 2020), it applies material-specific coefficients to quantify ecological compensation potential. The plugin calculates the balance and exports detailed CSV results.
